/**
 * Faculty Intelligence — centralized dataset aggregation.
 *
 * The single source of truth for every faculty dataset. Existing deterministic datasets
 * (courses, attendance, assignments, question bank, papers, PYQ, quiz,
 * exam blueprint, cohorts, weak students, analytics) is RE-EXPORTED here so
 * future modules import ONE place and never maintain isolated copies.
 * New datasets (classes/sections, teaching schedule, engagement, resources,
 * notifications, recommendation/insight pools) live alongside.
