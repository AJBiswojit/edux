/**
 * MediXO EduX — Student Intelligence Foundation (public API).
 *
 * One centralized, interconnected data layer for the Student module.
 *  - masterStudentProfile      → single source of truth for student identity
 *  - datasets                  → every academic dataset (all cross-referenced)
 *  - engine                    → deterministic mock-AI derivation functions
 *  - studentIntelligence       → fully assembled snapshot (base + derived)
 *
 * PHASE 27.1 — dual academic architecture:
 *  The derived snapshot now exposes TWO context-specific intelligence
 *  strategies over ONE common foundation:
 *
 *    derived.university    → University engine  (semester/course/academic)
 *    derived.competitive   → Competitive engine (exam/paper/PYQ/mock)
 *    derived.readiness     → ONE readiness orchestration layer
 *                            (readiness.university · readiness.competitive ·
 *                             readiness.byExamFamily {JEE, NEET})
 *
 *  Context isolation is enforced in the engines: university calculations
 *  never consume percentile/negative-marking/PYQ signals and competitive
 *  calculations never consume CGPA/university attendance.
 *
 * This module is UI-free and uses only relative imports so it can run in
 * plain Node (for tests/scripts) as well as the browser bundle.
