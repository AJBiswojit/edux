# PHASE D — AUTHENTICATION, AUTHORIZATION, RBAC + SECURITY REPORT

**Project:** MediXO EduX (`medixo-edux-platform` v1.0.0)
**Phase:** D — Authentication, Authorization, RBAC & Security Specification
**Nature:** Documentation-only phase. Zero application source code was modified, zero backend code implemented, zero security code created.
**Date:** 2026-08-23 · **Branch:** `arena/01a02f45-edux`

---

## 1. Baseline
- **Pre-requisites Completed:** Phase A (Architecture & UI Traceability), Phase B (API Contract & OpenAPI Specification), and Phase C (Data Model & Database Mapping).
- **Scope of Security Audit:** All 123 routes, 145 API endpoints, 16 localStorage persistence keys, 4 primary roles, and 3 academic tracks.

## 2. Authentication Audit
- **Current Mechanism:** In-browser deterministic prototype managed by `AuthContext.jsx` with demo persona logins (`aurora123`) and student registration registry (`aurora_registered_students`).
- **Axios Refresh Contract:** `src/api/axios.js` implements request interceptor (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`) and automatic `POST /auth/refresh` on HTTP 401.

## 3. Current Roles
- 4 canonical user roles verified from codebase: `student`, `faculty`, `admin`, `parent`.

## 4. RBAC Findings
- Exhaustive domain RBAC matrix established across all 22 functional domains.

## 5. Route Authorization
- Full audit of all 123 `<Route>` registrations in `src/routes/index.jsx` with assigned roles, guards (`ProtectedRoute.jsx`), and backend authorization requirements.

## 6. API Authorization
- Complete authorization rules defined for all 145 registered endpoints from Phase B.

## 7. Ownership Model
- Detailed ownership and CRUD permission matrix established for all major entities (`ExamAttempt`, `QuestionAttempt`, `Intervention`, `PracticeAttempt`, `QuestionPaper`, `Question`, `SourceDocument`).

## 8. Student Privacy
- Strict self-data isolation rules: students may only query their own records; group interventions sanitize peer identities.

## 9. Faculty Access
- Faculty access scoped strictly to assigned departments, courses, batches, and enrolled students.

## 10. Admin Access
- Institutional governance and executive intelligence access restricted to `role='admin'`.

## 11. Parent Access
- Parent access strictly authorized through explicit database links in `parent_students`.

## 12. Exam Security
- Answer key concealment during test delivery, server-side negative marking calculation, and strict separation between practice and official exam attempts.

## 13. Intervention Security
- Multi-student intervention assignment privacy with individual progress tracking and private remedial attempts.

## 14. Paper Security
- Draft paper confidentiality and audience-verified distribution to batch cohorts.

## 15. Question/File Security
- Universal Question Bank protection and strict file upload validation (MIME, 50MB limit, malware scanning, private S3 storage).

## 16. AI Security
- Prompt injection defense, source document sanitization, and model hallucination safeguards.

## 17. University/JEE/NEET Isolation
- **Critical Invariant:** Composite context verification on `(domain, exam_family)` preventing cross-track data contamination.

## 18. Tenant Isolation
- Multi-tenant query partition mandate: all queries MUST inject `WHERE institution_id = current_user.institution_id`.

## 19. IDOR Audit
- Documented IDOR vulnerabilities across URL parameter routes and established server-side session ownership checks.

## 20. Role Escalation Audit
- Prohibited trusting client-side role claims; backend relies exclusively on server-signed JWT tokens.

## 21. Session/Token Audit
- Defined short-lived access tokens (15m), single-use refresh token rotation (14d), and Redis revocation blacklists.

## 22. localStorage Security
- Audited all 16 localStorage keys and established migration priorities.

## 23. Secrets Audit
- Flagged demo passwords and hardcoded mock keys for replacement with environment variable secrets.

## 24. Security Headers/CORS/CSRF
- Defined CORS domain restrictions, CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, and CSRF protection.

## 25. Rate Limiting
- Established rate limits for authentication (5/min), registration (3/hr), and AI generation (20/min).

## 26. Audit Logging
- Specified immutable append-only `audit_logs` table in PostgreSQL for security events.

## 27. Data Classification
- Classified all entities across PUBLIC, INTERNAL, CONFIDENTIAL, SENSITIVE, and HIGHLY SENSITIVE tiers.

## 28. Security Gap Register
- Cataloged 7 primary prototype security gaps (`GAP-01` to `GAP-07`) with technical backend requirements.

## 29. Future Python Backend Security Architecture
- Defense-in-depth architecture documented in Section 27 of `07-SECURITY-AND-PRIVACY.md`.

## 30. Security Test Plan
- 10 automated security test suites defined covering authentication, RBAC, IDOR, multi-tenancy, and AI isolation.

## 31. Validation
- Complete security cross-check performed across all Phase A, B, C, and D specifications.

## 32. Tests
- **`npm test`**: **153 / 153 passed** (100% pass rate).

## 33. Build
- **`npm run build`**: **Production build succeeded** without errors.

## 34. Application Changes
**NO APPLICATION CODE CHANGED.**
Only `docs/backend-integration/` contains new documentation files.

## Summary & Completion
Documentation Phases A, B, C, and D are complete. The platform is architecturally, contractually, data-model, and security prepared for Python backend implementation.
